## Hacker News: Mark All Read

This is the source code for the [Chrome extension Hacker News: Mark All Read](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hacker-news-mark-all-read/fghfahcbhpdeeaaofcefaoodmfejieok). The is a fork of the [original code](https://github.com/danmaz74/HNMarkAllRead), developed by [Daniele Mazzini](https://github.com/danmaz74/) in 2012. The original project hasn't been updated in recent years, so I forked the code to make it work with the current version of HN site, and upgraded to Manifest v3 (which will be mandatory in 2024+). **All the credit goes to the original author**.

**Changelog:**
- 2023-11 - Published extension to Chrome Webstore
- 2023-02 - Upgraded Manifest from v2 to v3
- 2016-06 - Fixed post HN changes on June 1, 2016
- 2015-04 - Forked the original extension, and updated images, icons and color scheme


### Features

This extension improves the usability of the Hacker News website with the following six key features:

- **Mark Stories as Read** - No need to scan the whole list of news to find new entries! Simply press the button to mark all entries as read and gray them out.
- **Mark Comments as Read** - Same as Mark Stories as Read, but for comments.
- **Hide Read Comments** - When used in combination with Mark Comments as Read, you can easily see only new comments since you've last marked them as read.
- **Follow Comments** - Allows you to follow comments for a particular story. Followed stories are shown in a different color in the index whenever there's a new comment posted.
- **Show Parent Comment** - Hover over the "Show parent" next to each comment to quickly see the parent comment. This is incredibly helpful for deeply nested threads, so you can easily understand the parent context of the current reply.
- **Collapse / Expand All Comments** - You can collapse all comments so you can more quickly scan only the topline ones, and drill down when desired.

These features make it easier and faster to navigate and consume content on Hacker News, saving you time and improving your experience.
