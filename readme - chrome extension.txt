This is a fork of the original Chrome extension by Dan Mazzini (danmaz74). The original extension hasn't been updated, so this fork fixes compatibility with current HN layout, and updates to Manifest v3 (which will be mandatory starting in 2024). All the credit goes to the original author [1][2].

This extension helps you save time by improving the usability of the Hacker News with the following six key features:

1) Mark Stories as Read - No need to scan the whole list of news to find new entries! Simply press the button to mark all entries as read and gray them out.

2) Mark Comments as Read - Same as Mark Stories as Read, but for comments.

3) Hide Read Comments - When used in combination with Mark Comments as Read, you can easily see only new comments since you've last marked them as read.

4) Follow Comments - Allows you to follow comments for a particular story. Followed stories are shown in a different color in the index whenever there's a new comment posted.

5) Show Parent Comment - Hover over the "Show parent" next to each comment to quickly see the parent comment. This is incredibly helpful for deeply nested threads, so you can easily understand the parent context of the current reply.

6) Collapse / Expand All Comments - You can collapse all comments so you can more quickly scan only the topline ones, and drill down when desired.

Enjoy!
